Encryption

All data within Citus Cloud is encrypted at rest, including data on the instance as well as all backups for disaster recovery. We also require that you connect to your database with TLS.

Two-Factor Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We support two factor authentication for all Citus accounts. You can enable it from within your Citus Cloud account. We support Google Authenticator and Authy as two primary apps for setting up your two factor authentication.
